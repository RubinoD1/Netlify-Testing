Steps 

    • (HTML) In the HTML file add type=”module” to the JS file script tag: 

<script type="module" src="./assets/js/logic.js"></script>

    • (.gitignore) Add the name of the JS file containing the api key var (apikey.js) to the .gitignore file. 

    • Create a JS file that will contain the API key (apikey.js)
        ◦  In the JS file add the following code (insert the api key value as the const value): 
    
    ```
const WEATHER_API_KEY = “”;

export default WEATHER_API_KEY;

```

    • In the JS file that will be using the API key add the following code to the top of the file: 

```
import WEATHER_API_KEY from ‘./apikey.js’;
```

    • On the Netlify website in the deployment section for the site add the following to the Build Command section in deployment settings: 

```
cd assets && cd js && echo -e “const WEATHER_API_KEY = ‘ADD API KEY VALUE HERE’;\n\nexport default WEATHER_API_KEY;” > apikey.js

```
The build command is creating the JS file that is hidden with the .gitignore file preventing the API key from being visible in the GitHub repo. 

** The key will still be visible in the dev tools under the source menu as the file will be visible when the site loads **

Build command breakdown: 

    • cd assets && cd js: Tells Netlify to switch to the assets folder and then to the js folder where we want the file to be created. 
    • echo -e: tells the BASH terminal to pay attention to some line breaks we are going to put in the string. 
    • \n\n: is two line breaks. 
    • The > symbol (greater than) than the name of the file we want to create apikey.js
